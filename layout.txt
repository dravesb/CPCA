CPCA Talk 

Part 0 

- Motivation for the talk  
- Outline

Part 1: PCA 

- PCA Picture / Intuitive motivation
	- Penguins! 
- Notational setup with population parameters 
- Def first, second, and general PC
- Derive PC1 
- Derive PC2 
- Give matrix notation for k-PCs 
- Computational note: SVD 
- Give a full example 

Part 2: CPCA 

- CPCA motivation 
	- Return to penguin example and make a note about different species
	- Make a note about how there is no 'maximal variance direction'
- Introduce problem 
- MLE set up / Algorithmic solution
- CPCs and the X2 statistic
- Computational note: SVD 
- Back to penguins


Part 3: Randomized SVD 

- Motivate rSVD 
- Sketch Algorithm 
- Give a few high level error bounds
- Implement on Penguins and compare results
